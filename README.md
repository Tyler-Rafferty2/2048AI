# Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for 2048

This project implements a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to play the game 2048. MCTS is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in games, which combines random sampling of the search space with a tree-based structure to evaluate the potential outcomes of moves.

## Features

- **MCTS Algorithm**: Uses exploration and exploitation to simulate and evaluate possible game states.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust MCTS iterations, exploration constants, and simulation depth for better performance.
- **2048 Game Environment**: Fully functional 2048 game implemented in Python.
- **Heuristic-Based Scoring**: Evaluates board states to maximize tile values and merges.
